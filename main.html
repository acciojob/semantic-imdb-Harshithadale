		The story follows Shivudu (Mahendra Baahubali), a young man raised in a village, who discovers his royal lineage and his connection to the kingdom of Mahishmati. As he learns about his father, Amarendra Baahubali, and the betrayal that led to his tragic fate, Shivudu seeks revenge against his evil uncle Bhallaladeva, who wrongfully seized the throne.
